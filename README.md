=========================================

This is a demo repository where I try to figure out how to use [cucumber-js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) to drive development of an interactive CLI tool that sends requests to a remote server.

Installation:
```sh
npm i
```

Run tests:
```sh
npm test
```

Run command:
```sh
bin/run
```
